TODOS:

- user should not be able to act as another user (e.g see his recommendations, create a recomm. in his name, etc.)
- making a nice layout for all views (see feather)
- "given" blocks cause more pain than help since they destroy and recreate users so user instances reference other objects and that makes tests brittle. Replace them/think about how/when they could be used well. It is probably better to have spec_helper functions that can be passed object instances, e.g:

def do_login(user)
	response = request(url(:perform_login), login = user.login, password = user.password)
end

DONE:

- make box on recommendation box accept a name
- a user should not be able to recommend himself
- authenticate for user tasks
- check that admin actions are only available to admins
- write specs to see if actions of recommendations.rb are protected
- make name box on recommendation page auto-complete
